I used JavaScript to develop the application. 

Pre-requisite to run the application

**node.js**

Run the following command to calculate number of days between two dates.

```
node index.js 01/12/2015 31/12/2015
```

The order of dates does not matter. If the first date is greater than second date then I will swap them.	


To run tests you will need **mocha**.

Install mocha globally

```
npm install -g mocha

``` 

After installing mocha, go to the application's directory and run


```
npm install

```
command above will install the dependencies. 

Run ``` npm test ``` to run all the tests
